			implement the principles of the Kingdom of God. We desire churches and
			believers to be dedicated to winning souls for God, restoring those who
			have fallen, and helping those with different problems for their spiritual
			growth. We do not intend to replace the mission of the Lord's Church but
			rather emphasize, motivate, and serve as a bridge for evangelizing people
			and serving believers.
