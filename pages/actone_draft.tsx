                Our destination is Orion, located in the southern part of Bataan Peninsula. For one month, you will have
                the opportunity to present to the Romanian community what itâ€™s like to be a missionary in Asia - the
                highs and the lows, the joys and the sorrows.
                <Break /> We will split into groups of four missionaries, accompanied by videographers who will capture
                all the important moments of the day - from the moment you go out to serve, to the end of the day
                debrief.
                <Break />
                You'll have the opportunity to serve in a number of different areas, including visiting schools, playing
                with kids, encouraging pastors and the local church family, helping with construction projects,
                attending local church events, and encouraging kids at schools and in their communities. All these
                activities will build your faith and teach you the value of servanthood.

              <div>
                With a population of more than 106 million people across its 7,500 islands, the Philippines proudly
                boasts to be the only Christian nation in Asia. Heavily influenced by the West, they are the
                fifth-largest English-speaking country, and Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion with about 80%
                of Filipinos identifying as such. Only 13% identify as evangelical Christians. There is great need for
                evangelism, church strengthening, leadership development, and cross-cultural missions training in the
                Philippines.
                <Break />
                Arise for Christ has been partnering with local churches in the Bataan region for multiple years, being
                involved in church planting and other missionary work.
